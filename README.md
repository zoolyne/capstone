# Capstone

This is just a place for me to collect the different C# files for my unity project

Each file is a script used in the unity project for my game. Their purpose is mostly evident from their names, however comments in the code provide additional clarification. 

I've only uploaded the code here that I have personally written for this project, however there are additional files included in the game that are from assets I have downloaded from the Unity Asset Store, which might be referenced here. The code can be found in the game folders under "assets" if you are curious of their details.
